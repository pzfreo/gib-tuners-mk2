## Manufacturing Notes

- **Profile Type:** ZI
- **Wheel Generation:** Virtual hobbing (72 steps)
- **Worm Type:** Globoid

## Validation

**Status:** ❌ Design has errors

### Errors

- **CONTACT_RATIO_TOO_LOW**: Calculated contact ratio 0.33 < 1.0. Teeth will not maintain continuous contact.
  - *Suggestion*: Increase wheel teeth count or lead angle for smoother operation. DIN 3975 §7.4 recommends contact ratio >= 1.2

### Warnings

- **TEETH_UNDERCUT_RISK**: Wheel has 10 teeth, minimum is 12 for 25.0° pressure angle
  - *Suggestion*: Use profile shift coefficient ≥ 0.18 to avoid undercut (current: 0.00)
- **TEETH_VERY_LOW**: Wheel has only 10 teeth. This is unusual for worm gears.
  - *Suggestion*: Consider higher ratio or multi-start worm for better contact ratio
- **WHEEL_BORE_THIN_RIM**: Wheel rim is thin (0.62mm) with bore 3.2mm
  - *Suggestion*: Consider reducing bore for adequate strength

### Information

- Drive is self-locking (backdrive prevented)
- ZI profile selected - involute helicoid for high precision hobbed gears
- Throat reduction: 0.12mm (hourglass depth ~0.23mm)
- Globoid worm provides better contact area with wheel
- Recommended: wheel width 7.20mm, worm length 11.97mm

## Notes

- All dimensions in millimeters unless otherwise noted
- Efficiency estimate assumes steel worm on bronze wheel with lubrication
- Self-locking determination is approximate - verify with actual materials
- Throat diameter is for enveloping (throated) wheel design
- Recommended dimensions are guidelines based on contact ratio requirements
