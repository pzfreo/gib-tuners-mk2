## Manufacturing Notes

- **Profile Type:** ZA (straight flanks - standard for CNC machining)
- **Wheel Generation:** Virtual hobbing (72 steps)
- **Worm Type:** Globoid

## Validation

**Status:** ❌ Design has errors

### Errors

- **CONTACT_RATIO_TOO_LOW**: Calculated contact ratio 0.36 < 1.0. Teeth will not maintain continuous contact.
  - *Suggestion*: Increase wheel teeth count or lead angle for smoother operation. DIN 3975 §7.4 recommends contact ratio >= 1.2
- **GEOMETRIC_INTERFERENCE**: Worm and wheel geometries interfere (clearance: -0.31mm)
  - *Suggestion*: Check calculator inputs - this geometry is impossible

### Warnings

- **TEETH_VERY_LOW**: Wheel has only 11 teeth. This is unusual for worm gears.
  - *Suggestion*: Consider higher ratio or multi-start worm for better contact ratio
- **THROAT_REDUCTION_SMALL**: Throat reduction (0.17mm) is less than 0.3x module (0.18mm)
  - *Suggestion*: May result in minimal hourglass effect and reduced wheel contact
- **WHEEL_BORE_THIN_RIM**: Wheel rim is thin (1.10mm) with bore 3.5mm
  - *Suggestion*: Consider reducing bore for adequate strength

### Information

- Wheel has 11 teeth with profile shift 0.50 to avoid undercut
- Drive is self-locking (backdrive prevented)
- Throat reduction: 0.17mm (0.3x module, hourglass depth ~0.33mm)
- Globoid worm provides better contact area with wheel
- Recommended: wheel width 7.20mm, worm length 11.97mm

## Notes

- All dimensions in millimeters unless otherwise noted
- Efficiency estimate assumes steel worm on bronze wheel with lubrication
- Self-locking determination is approximate - verify with actual materials
- Throat diameter is for enveloping (throated) wheel design
- Recommended dimensions are guidelines based on contact ratio requirements
