# Create Engineering Drawing from build123d Geometry

Use this skill when asked to create or fix an engineering drawing (DWG-NNN) for a
build123d component. The drawings live in `scripts/drawings/` and export to
`drawings/` (gitignored — regenerate each session).

---

## Step 0 — Understand the part first

Before writing any drawing code, use the MCP server to build and inspect the geometry:

```
mcp__build123d-mcp__execute  — build the part in the session
mcp__build123d-mcp__measure  — confirm volume, bbox, face count
mcp__build123d-mcp__render_view (save_to='/tmp/preview.png') — visual sanity check
```

Note the bounding-box extents. These drive layout decisions below.

---

## Step 1 — Choose views (third-angle projection)

Standard four-view layout for A4 landscape (297 × 210 mm):

| View | Camera position | Up vector | Role |
|------|-----------------|-----------|------|
| Main (front/side) | face the longest axis | +Z or +Y | primary dims |
| Left/right end | +X or -X | +Z | cross-section / bore |
| Plan (top) | +Z | +Y | footprint |
| Isometric | (80,80,80) or (100,-100,100) | +Z | pictorial, no dims |

Verify axis mapping **before** placing any dimensions:

```
mcp__build123d-mcp__view_axes(viewport_origin=[...], viewport_up=[...])
```

This returns `world_X → page_X (±1), world_Y → page_X (±1)` etc.
Copy the result into the script as a comment — it is the source of truth for
coordinate helpers.

---

## Step 2 — Scale and project

```python
SCALE = 2.0          # 2:1 for small components; 1:1 for assemblies
part_2x = part.scale(SCALE)

# look_at must be in 2x space for scaled views; 1x space for the iso
look_at_2x = (cx * SCALE, cy * SCALE, cz * SCALE)

vis, hid = part_2x.project_to_viewport(camera_pos, up, look_at_2x)
iso_vis, iso_hid = part.project_to_viewport((80, 80, 80), (0,0,1), (cx, cy, cz))
```

Place each projected compound at its sheet position:

```python
VIEW_X, VIEW_Y = 148.0, 115.0   # sheet centre for this view
view = Compound(children=list(vis)).locate(Location((VIEW_X, VIEW_Y, 0)))
view_h = Compound(children=list(hid)).locate(Location((VIEW_X, VIEW_Y, 0))) if hid else None
```

---

## Step 3 — Coordinate helpers

Write one helper per view so annotation coords are derived from world geometry,
not hardcoded page numbers. Pattern (example for a view where world_Z → page_X):

```python
# Side view: world_Z → page_X (+1), world_Y → page_Y (+1), look_at Z=z_center
def SX(z): return SV_X + z * SCALE - z_center * SCALE
def SY(y): return SV_Y + y * SCALE
```

Verify a known extent (e.g. top of part) maps to a sensible page Y before using.

---

## Step 4 — Annotate with build123d_drafting

```python
from build123d_drafting import (
    Dimension, Leader, TitleBlock,
    annotate, draft_preset, lint_drawing, place_dims, set_page,
)

draft = draft_preset(font_size=2.5, decimal_precision=1)
```

**Stacked dimensions** (use `place_dims` — it handles offset stacking automatically):

```python
dims = place_dims([
    ((x0, y_base, 0), (x1, y_base, 0), "below", "14.8"),
    ((x0, y_base, 0), (x2, y_base, 0), "below",  "7.1"),
], draft)
for i, d in enumerate(dims):
    annotate(d, f"dim_name_{i}")
```

**Leaders** (diameter callouts, part labels):

```python
ldr = Leader(
    tip=(page_x, page_y, 0),
    elbow=(elbow_x, elbow_y, 0),
    label="ø4.0 BEARING",
    draft=draft,
)
annotate(ldr, "ldr_bearing_d")
```

**Title block** (always include):

```python
tb = TitleBlock(
    "PART NAME", "DWG-NNN",
    scale="2:1",
    material="CZ121 BRASS",
    general_tolerance="ISO 2768-f",
    designed_by="GIB TUNERS",
    date="YYYY-MM-DD",
    width=150.0,
    draft=draft,
).locate(Location((126, 11, 0)))
annotate(tb, "title_block")
```

Every annotation object **must** be passed to `annotate()` — otherwise lint and
export will not see it.

---

## Step 5 — Lint gate (run before export)

```python
all_anns = list(dims) + [ldr1, ldr2, tb]
set_page(297, 210, margin=10)
issues = lint_drawing(all_anns, drawing_scale=SCALE)
if issues:
    for iss in issues:
        print(f"  [{iss.severity}] {iss.code}: {iss.message}")
else:
    print("Lint: OK")
```

Do not export until lint is clean (or all issues are understood and accepted).

Common lint failures and fixes:
- `label_axis_swap` — dimension endpoints are swapped (X↔Y); check coord helper signs
- `label_mismatch` — label string doesn't match the geometric distance; recheck scale
- `page_bounds` — annotation is outside the 297×210 margin; adjust view position

---

## Step 6 — Export SVG and DXF

```python
part_color = Color(0, 0, 0)
hid_color  = Color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
dim_color  = Color(0, 0.2, 0.7)

svg_exp = ExportSVG(margin=10)
svg_exp.add_layer("part",   line_color=part_color, line_weight=0.5)
svg_exp.add_layer("hidden", line_color=hid_color,  line_weight=0.25,
                  line_type=LineType.HIDDEN)
svg_exp.add_layer("dims",   line_color=dim_color,  fill_color=dim_color,
                  line_weight=0.05)
for shape in [view1, view2, view3, iso]:
    svg_exp.add_shape(shape, layer="part")
for shape in [s for s in [v1_h, v2_h, v3_h, iso_h] if s]:
    svg_exp.add_shape(shape, layer="hidden")
for ann in all_anns:
    svg_exp.add_shape(ann, layer="dims")
svg_exp.write(str(output_dir / "part_name.svg"))
```

Repeat with `ExportDXF` (same layers, no `line_color`/`fill_color` args).

---

## Step 7 — Verify the SVG with the MCP server

```
mcp__build123d-mcp__render_drawing(svg_path='drawings/part_name.svg', save_to='/tmp/dwg.png')
```

Send with `[SEND: /tmp/dwg.png]` for user review before moving on.

---

## Step 8 — Regenerate the PDF

Once all SVGs are ready:

```bash
uv run python scripts/drawings/make_pdf.py
```

Output: `drawings/tuner_drawings.pdf`

---

## Layout rules of thumb

- Leave ≥ 12 mm between any two view outlines.
- Dimension lines below/left of the view they measure; leaders elbows clear the geometry.
- Isometric goes in the corner least occupied by orthographic views (usually bottom-left or far right).
- Title block: bottom-right, 150–170 mm wide, Y anchor ≈ 11 mm from bottom.
- Don't put dimensions on the isometric — it is a pictorial only.

---

## Files to look at for patterns

- `scripts/drawings/frame.py` — simplest; linear dims only
- `scripts/drawings/string_post.py` — stacked dims, multiple leaders, end views
- `scripts/drawings/peg_head.py` — axis-along-X part, ring-end + shaft-end views
- `scripts/drawings/assembly.py` — multi-component assembly, 1-housing variant
- `scripts/drawings/worm_wheel.py` — imported STEP geometry, gear annotations
